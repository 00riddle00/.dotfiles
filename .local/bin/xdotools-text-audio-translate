#*
# Script using xdotool to aid in learning natural languages. It automates the
# process of translating selected words from a book in a text format, while
# listening to that book in an audio format.
#
# Assumptions before running the script:
#  [1] A web browser with a functionality to give a custom name to a browser
#      window.
#  [2] A book in a text format (HTML, PDF, etc.) is opened in a browser window,
#      window name set to "text-book".
#  [3] A book in an audio format is opened in a browser window in YouTube,
#      window name set to "youtube-audiobook". Any audio or video file can be
#      uploaded to YouTube, it is not limited to existing audiobooks on
#      YouTube.
#  [4] Google Translate is opened in a browser window with the languages set to
#      translate from and to, window name set to "google-translate". The polar
#      coordinates of the Google Translate text input field are set to 315
#      degrees and 900 pixels from the center of the window.
#  [5] The mouse cursor is placed on the word which needs to be translated in
#      the book's text.
#
#  The window names and polar coordinates can be changed in the script.
#
#  Having all three browser windows opened, place the mouse cursor on the word
#  to translate in the book's text and run the keyboard shortcut mapped to this
#  script. The script will:
#    - Select and copy the word to the clipboard.
#    - Pause the audiobook.
#    - Rewind the audiobook by 5 seconds.
#    - Clear the Google Translate input field.
#    - Paste the word to Google Translate.
#    - Wait for 5 seconds (this can also be changed in the script).
#    - Resume the audiobook.
#    - Return the mouse cursor to the original position.
#    - Deselect the word.
#
# After a listening exercise, you can copy the words from Google Translate
# history to your notes. Map this script to a keyboard shortcut and enjoy
# learning languages!
#**

#* USAGE:
#*   The script is not supposed to be run directly, but rather from a keyboard
#*   shortcut mapped to it, since it requires the mouse cursor to be in a
#*   specific position on the screen.

# Variables which can be customized.
